# OpenSanctions API example code

The OpenSanctions API can easily be queried using any HTTP client. You can use
the [OpenAPI specification](https://api.opensanctions.org/) to generate a client
for your platform, or make HTTP requests directly.

This repository contains code examples for a few common programming languages.

Get started using our [Matching API tutorial](https://www.opensanctions.org/docs/api/matching/),
but come back here if you'd like ready-to-use examples in these languages/platforms:
